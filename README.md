In today’s international, everyone opts for  an instant reaction that ensures a brief response.
The goal of this project is to create touch free and remote free control over any video.
This project is an innovative development in the field of human computer interaction, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with media.
This project makes life easier, comfortable by letting us to control the device from a distance.
An automated media player using hand gestures is a system that allows users to control media playback through the use of hand gestures.
This technology is typically powered by machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, which allows the system to interpret user hand gestures and respond accordingly.
The idea behind an automated media player using hand gestures is to create a more intuitive and natural user inter-hand for media playback.

**LIBRARIES:**

1)opencv – It is an open source computer vision and ML software library which is used to identify, detect, match features from images captured by camera.

2)mediapipe- It is used to identify hand landmarks and process time-series data like video, audio, etc.  

3)pyautogui – It lets our Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions on applications without any external device. 

4)time – It is used to detect pause/delay from execution.

**OUTPUT:**

1 finger raised  - It will move a video forward 

2 fingers raised - It will move a video backward

3 fingers raised - It will deal with volume up

4 fingers raised - It will deal with volume down

5 fingers raised - It will deal with playing,pausing a video

**ADVANTAGES:**

a)It provides an innovative and convenient way of interacting with multimedia content.

b)It enhances user experience by enabling hands-free operation.

c)It increases accessibility for individuals.

d)Easy to perform ,fast ,efficient and ensure an immediate response.
